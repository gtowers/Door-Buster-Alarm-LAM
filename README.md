# Door-Buster-Alarm-LAM
This project is to develop a battery operated magnetic box that will be attached to manufacturing panels at LAM. 
The box has several criteria, but the most important ones are that the box detect panel doors when they are opened.  I have tested this once when the only requirement was that the siren go off for 20 seconds and a light continues to flash until the operator corrects the situation. The customer tested the box, and then came back with several new criteria.  Perhaps unfortunately, but certain decisions have been made, that I do not want to change at this point.    They are as follows:
1)  The battery is required to last 7 days 24 hours a day without the need of a recharge.  This is a customer requirement.
2)  The battery will be 12VDC, that is because the sensor I chose to use requres 11 VDC minimum.  I have chosen an allen-bradley photodetector.
3)   The customer has requested that there be some way that administration can look at the history as the box travels down the "assembly line".  Creating a history of when the box has alarmed.
4)   The customer wants a protective "cage" for the alarm and horn so that if dropped, the beacon/horn won't be damaged.
5)  I am using a lithium polymer battery.  Charging this battery requires a "2 cable" set up.  The customer would like this to become a more simple 1 cable plug
6)  The customer wants a battery sensor that will let them know when the battery is drained to make sure that the battery is charged whenever required.
7)  The customer did not like the looks of the box.  I found a local vendor who has provided me with a box of brushed stainless steel, so this requirement has been satisfied.
