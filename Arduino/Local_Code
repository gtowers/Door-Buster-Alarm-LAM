/*
 * *********Arduino to be located in Buster Box********
 * This Arduino wil only be turned on when the sensor 
 * detects that the door has been opened.  The power to the
 * sensor will be on continuosly and a relay will close that
 * will be responsibile for energizing the arduino.
 * At the same time, this relay will energize the siren
 * and beacon.  There will be a 20 second delay after power up,
 * at the end of this time, the siren will turn off but the blinking light 
 * will stay on until the door alarm has been cleared.
